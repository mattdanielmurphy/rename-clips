# Why is this here?

I accidentally uploaded 
On S3:
- Stems are all from Session 2
- Samples are from *both* Session 1 and Session 2 (although there's 362 missing)
  
On sample generator site:
- pulls from list of uploaded clips, which are all from Session 1
  - but what it thinks is Session 1 is actually Session 2
